# Portfolio Site
Portfolio site containing links to my projects. A minimalistic approach was taken to emphasize each block of content.
## Lessons Learned
First time using React to build a full site. Really liked dividing the work of multiple componenets into their own JSX files to make organizatoin much easier. Had fun learning about AoS (Animate on Scroll) to make elements appear as the viewport scrolls.

Had to learn how to use SASS variables and funcitons in CSS to minimize the amount of code. Also learned how to make semantic HTML using dedicated tags for specific sections of the site. Had to learn about React's directory to practice separation of concerns for file types.
## Possible Future Features
- Responsive design to fit mobile and tablet screens, using media queries to accomplish this.
- Animated snippets of paint brushes and ink lines drawing across the screen as viewport scrolls.
- Functional contact form.
## Deployment
